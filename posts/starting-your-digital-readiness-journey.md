I've written a lot over the past year about digital readiness — what it means, why it matters, where businesses get stuck. But I realize I haven't laid out a clear, practical guide for actually getting started. So that's what this is. No theory, no frameworks with fancy acronyms. Just the steps that I've seen work for real businesses with real constraints.

If you're running a business with 50 to 200 people and you know things need to change but you're not sure where to begin, this is for you.

## Step One: Talk to Your People First

This might seem obvious, but it's the step that gets skipped most often. Leaders tend to start with strategy sessions, vendor evaluations, or technology research. All of that has its place — later. The first thing you should do is talk to the people who do the work every day.

Not a survey. Not a town hall. Actual conversations, ideally one-on-one or in small groups, with people across different teams and roles. Ask them where they waste time. Ask what frustrates them about their tools and processes. Ask what they wish worked differently. Ask what information they need that's hard to get.

You'll learn more in a week of these conversations than in a month of strategic planning. Your people know where the problems are — they live with them every day. They just haven't been asked.

When we help businesses with readiness assessments, this is always where we start, and it's consistently the most valuable part of the process. The patterns that emerge from these conversations almost always point to the real priorities, which are rarely what leadership assumed they'd be.

## Step Two: Map What's Actually Happening

Once you've talked to your people, map your key processes as they actually work — not as they're supposed to work, not as they're documented (if they're documented at all), but as they truly operate day to day.

This means capturing the workarounds, the manual steps, the "oh, we also check this spreadsheet" moments, the information that lives in someone's head. It means documenting where data moves between systems, how it gets there, and where it gets stuck or lost.

This exercise is almost always eye-opening. I worked with a company that discovered their order fulfillment process had 23 manual handoff points — steps where information moved from one person or system to another through manual effort. They thought it was maybe eight or nine. The difference between the perceived process and the actual process was enormous, and it explained a lot about why things kept falling through the cracks.

You don't need fancy process mapping software for this. Whiteboard sessions with the people who do the work are perfectly effective. The goal isn't a beautiful diagram — it's shared understanding of reality.

## Step Three: Measure Where You Are

Before you can improve anything, you need a baseline. This doesn't need to be exhaustive, but you should know some basic things about your current state.

How long do key processes actually take, end to end? Where are the bottlenecks? How much time does your team spend on manual data movement? What's your error rate on critical processes? How quickly can you pull the reports you need to run the business?

These measurements serve two purposes. First, they help you prioritize — the biggest gaps are usually where you should focus first. Second, they give you a way to track progress. Six months from now, when someone asks "is this working?", you'll have numbers to point to instead of feelings.

## Step Four: Prioritize Ruthlessly

By this point, you'll have a list of problems and opportunities that's probably longer than you'd like. The temptation is to try to tackle them all, or to start with the most exciting one, or to go after whatever a vendor is selling you this week.

Resist all of that. Instead, prioritize based on two things: impact and feasibility. Which problems, if solved, would create the most value for your business? And which of those are realistic to address given your current resources, timeline, and organizational capacity for change?

The intersection of high impact and high feasibility is where you should start. This usually means picking two or three things, not ten. It means saying no to good ideas in order to say yes to the best ones. It means accepting that the big, transformative changes will come later, and that's okay.

I've watched businesses try to change everything at once. It almost never works. The ones that succeed pick their battles carefully and build momentum through visible wins.

## Step Five: Start Small and Show Results

Your first digital readiness initiative should be something you can complete in weeks, not months. Something that will make a noticeable difference in people's daily work. Something that gives you a win to build on.

Maybe it's connecting two systems that currently require manual data transfer. Maybe it's automating a report that someone spends hours compiling every week. Maybe it's implementing a simple workflow tool for a process that currently runs on email and memory.

The specific initiative matters less than the approach: pick something contained, execute it well, measure the results, and make sure people feel the difference. That credibility is what fuels everything that comes after.

## Step Six: Get an Outside Perspective

I debated whether to include this because it sounds self-serving. But I genuinely believe it's important, so I'll say it anyway.

When you're inside a business, it's hard to see the patterns clearly. You're too close to the problems. Things that an outsider would immediately flag as inefficient feel normal because they've always been that way. Internal politics and history make certain conversations difficult. And it's hard to benchmark yourself against other businesses when you only see your own.

An external perspective — whether that's a consultant, an advisor, a peer group, or a formal assessment — can accelerate your understanding dramatically. The key is finding someone who will be honest with you, who understands businesses like yours, and who isn't just trying to sell you a product.

## The Most Important Thing

If I could leave you with one thought, it's this: don't wait until you have a perfect plan. The businesses that make the most progress on digital readiness are the ones that start with imperfect action rather than waiting for perfect strategy.

Talk to your people. Understand your current state. Pick one thing to improve. Do it well. Then pick the next thing.

Digital readiness isn't a project with a finish line. It's a way of operating — a commitment to continuously understanding how your business works and making it work better. The journey matters more than the destination, and the best time to start is now.

If you want help with this, that's what we do. We help businesses understand where they are, figure out where to focus, and build a practical path forward. No hundred-page strategy decks, no eighteen-month implementation plans. Just honest assessment and practical next steps.
