I get asked this question a lot: "Are we ready for digital transformation?" And honestly, most of the time, the people asking already know the answer. They're asking because something feels off — processes that should be simple aren't, information that should be available isn't, and their team spends way too much time on things that feel like they should be automated by now.

Digital readiness isn't about having the latest technology. It's not about whether you've adopted AI or moved everything to the cloud. It's something much more fundamental than that.

## What Digital Readiness Actually Means

For a company with 50 to 200 people, digital readiness comes down to one question: can your systems, processes, and people adapt when things change?

That's it. When a new customer segment emerges, can you pivot your operations to serve them? When a key employee leaves, does critical knowledge walk out the door with them? When you need to pull a report on last quarter's performance, does it take five minutes or five days?

Digital readiness is the organizational capacity to respond to change without everything grinding to a halt. And for most growing businesses, this capacity erodes slowly — so slowly that you don't notice until you're already behind.

## The Warning Signs

Over the past few years, I've worked with enough mid-sized businesses to recognize the patterns. Here are some of the things I see most often.

**Your team is the integration layer.** If your people are the ones moving data between systems — copying numbers from your CRM into spreadsheets, manually updating inventory counts, re-entering customer information across platforms — that's a red flag. Humans are terrible at being middleware. They make mistakes, they get frustrated, and they're doing work that adds zero value.

**Decisions wait for one person.** In many businesses, there's one person who "just knows" how things work. They're the only one who can pull certain reports, or they hold the institutional knowledge about key processes. That's not a strength — it's a single point of failure.

**You can't answer basic questions quickly.** How much revenue did we generate from new customers last month? What's our average fulfillment time? How many support tickets are open right now? If answering these questions requires someone to dig through multiple systems and compile data manually, your business isn't digitally ready.

**New tools create more problems than they solve.** You bought a project management tool, but half the team still uses email. You implemented a CRM, but the data is six months out of date. Technology that doesn't get adopted isn't technology — it's expensive shelfware.

## It's Not About the Technology

I want to be clear about something: the technology is almost never the problem. I've seen businesses running on decade-old systems that are more digitally ready than companies with brand-new everything. The difference is in how they think about their processes and their data.

A digitally ready business has clear processes that are documented and understood. It has data that's reasonably clean and accessible. It has people who are willing to learn and adapt. And it has leadership that understands why this matters.

You don't need to rip and replace everything. You need to understand where you are, where the gaps are, and what to do about them — in the right order.

## Questions Worth Asking Yourself

If you're running a growing business and you're not sure where you stand, here are some questions that might help.

Can a new employee get up to speed on your core processes without relying entirely on tribal knowledge? Is your customer data in one place, or scattered across inboxes, spreadsheets, and sticky notes? When something goes wrong in your operations, how long does it take to figure out what happened and why? If you needed to scale your team by 50% in six months, would your current systems support that?

These aren't trick questions, and there are no perfect answers. But if you found yourself wincing at any of them, that's useful information.

## Where to Start

The temptation is always to start with technology — buy a new platform, implement a new tool, hire a consultant to build something custom. But in my experience, the businesses that succeed with digital transformation are the ones that start with understanding.

Understand your current state. Map your processes. Talk to your people about where they're spending time on things that feel wasteful. Look at where information gets lost or delayed.

That understanding is the foundation for everything that comes after. Without it, you're just guessing — and guessing is expensive.

Digital readiness isn't a destination. It's a continuous process of asking honest questions about how your business works and being willing to do something about the answers. The good news is that the first step is the easiest: just start looking.
